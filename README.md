# Classifying-Lego-Brick-Images
This project uses a convolutional neural network for the problem of classifying different types of LEGO brick images.

The dataset we will use includes 40,000 “.png” images of 50 different types of LEGO bricks.
Each brick category has 800 different images of the brick at varying angles. The image size is
400x400.

Here is the link to that specific dataset:

The database from the first link also provides us with a listing of the validation set:
